# Background
This code is written as an example to support the [99 Bottles of Beer website](http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/).

I don't drink beer. I just saw a way to contribute some Swift code.

# Building
Open playground using the latest [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

You can also open a terminal window and run
```swift
swift BottlesOfBeer.playground/Contents.swift
```

# Sample Lyrics

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

...

1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
